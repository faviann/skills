# Enforce the non-live boundary in the validation command

`./validate.sh` establishes the repository's non-live Ansible environment once
for its entire run. It exports `ANSIBLE_INVENTORY` and
`ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` to repository-owned fixtures under `tests/`, so
lint, lifecycle launchers, pytest, and their descendants inherit the same
inputs. The fixture inventory names only the test hosts and supplies no host
addresses or SSH settings. A forgotten `connection: local` therefore cannot
resolve a managed host through production inventory. The fixture passphrase is
an inert placeholder, not a credential.

The shared regression-test helper asserts these fixture paths before it builds
the locked `uv run --locked ansible-playbook` invocation. Tests that pass their
own inventory must declare that exception explicitly; they still require the
fixture vault-password file. A plain pytest invocation does not establish this
environment, and the helper directs callers to `./validate.sh tests` when the
boundary is absent.

Per-fixture safety was rejected because hand-written `connection: local` and
individually supplied inventories make isolation depend on every test author.
Editing each playbook invocation to repeat the fixture paths was rejected as
duplicated policy that can drift. Depending on the workstation inventory and
machine-local vault passphrase was rejected because validation must not require
operator credentials. Making validation fully offline was also rejected: the
required boundary is no managed host, no vault secret, and no machine-specific
credential; public-network reads remain permitted.

This decision governs Ansible processes descended from `./validate.sh`. It does
not claim that arbitrary direct test or launcher invocations inherit the
fixtures, and it does not prohibit controlled fixture-local execution or
public-network access. It changes neither live lifecycle commands nor their
locking and wrapper safeguards.
